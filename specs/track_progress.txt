sp/track_progress
args:
	-Song identifier (seems to be unique to individual playing of a song. )
		Song identifier is sent from spotify to the client as "lid" in response to the "sp/track_uri" request.
	-Song "origin"? ("playlist" is the only example I've seen)
	-Song "play origin"? ("clickrow"/"trackend". Maybe "how this song started")
	-Current song position in ms
		-This is always in intervals of 15,000 EXCEPT for the first call, which is 500.
	-Playlist the song is located in ("spotify:user:xxx:playlist:yyy")
		-Is probably different if the song is loaded from, say, an album
	-Track URI
	-Playlist the song is located in again ("spotify:app:playlist:xxx") (notice the :app: part)
	-"0.1.0" (Version number most likely)
	-"com.spotify"
